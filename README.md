## About the Project
The Landing Page project was developed as part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The project was to create a web page based on a design provided to us, focus on the Flexbox knowledge.

The page was developed based on HTML and CSS, and I decided to design a page for a super club dinning experience to include specific images and page content based on this specific idea.

The challenge to create this page was to try to make it responsible, and be able to implement the design without let the images overflow the boxes. By using the flexbox properly, and defining specific sizes for some elements, such as the images or boxes, or using the flex-wrap property, I was able to accomplish the upcoming results.
